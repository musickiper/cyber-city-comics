# Cyber City Comics Demo

This is a demo project for Stratus360's full stack developer position. I tried to implement it without using any modern web framework. As I was not sure if I could use those fancy tools while working on this task. I mainly used only vanilla javascript and html. I used express.js framework only for routing for deployment and for view counter.

The code might looks a little bit massy and long because I only used vanilla js ways. If you want, I can make all codes simpler and cleaner using modern web frameworks like React.js

Thank you :)
